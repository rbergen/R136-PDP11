ST0
There is a big, hairy gnu here, that looks at you with two sneaky eyes.
Between the hairs of its fur there are all kinds of small creeping creatures
that you have never seen before. A horrible smell comes off the beast.
Drooling and puffing heavily, it approaches you.
ST1
The gnu takes a leap and thrusts its large head hard into your stomach. You
feel like your lungs are being pressed out of your body. Dazed, you get back
on your feet.
ST2
The gnu sees the meat, sniffs it and gobbles it up in one go.
You see it swell up slowly and its brains come out through its eye sockets.
It collapses and remains completely still.
ST3
The bobbed body of the gnu are on the floor, with its brains forming a puddle
next to it.
