ST0
There is a creature here that can be best described as a lump. It looks at
you with two sneaky eyes, scavy spots are on its skin, and algae grow on the
corners of its mouth. With its long, slippery tentacles it holds on to all
walls of the cave, blocking your path.
ST1
The lump is still sucked solidly to the cave walls, and it trembles lightly.
ST2
When you push the lever down, you see a brown-grey gas spray out of the 
cartridge.
The lump's trembling increases, and cracks start to appear in its scavy skin.
Making a slurping sound, its tentacles start to come loose from the rock walls,
and it collapses into a heap.
ST3
When you push the lever down, you see a brown-grey gas spray out of the 
cartridge.
You can see that the lump trembling starts to increase, before you are hit by
a pounding headache and fall over. You have nothing to protect against the
gas, and you lose consciousness. After a while, you come to.
ST4
The lump's torn body is covered in fungus. Isopods and earwigs crawl out of
its stomach. A strong smell of rotting emerges, and a small puddle of slime
slowly appears.
