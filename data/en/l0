ST0
There is a giant hell hound here, that blocks your path. His sharp teeth are
clearly visible, and red drool slowly drips from its mouth. It looks
threateningly at you with its blood-shot eyes, and a deep growl rises from
its throat.
ST1
The hell hound leaps forward and jumps on top of your body. His nails dig into
your flesh, and at some points he bites you hard in the shoulder. Your bones
crunch and a jolt of pain shoot through your nerves. The hound releases you
and looks at you as it growls.
ST2
The hunger of the hell hound has not been satisfied yet. A deep growl comes
out of its throat, and it's ready to attack again.
ST3
Due to the wounds you've inflicted with your sword, the heavily bleeding hell
hound dies. You strike one more time, and a piece of hound meat comes off.
ST4
The dead hell hound lies in a steaming pool of blood.
