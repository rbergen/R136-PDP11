With the first step you take into the swamp, you feel that you no longer have
solid footing. Despite trying desparately to stay above, you slowly sink into
the swamp. When you're neck-deep in the bubbling, muddy mass you hold your
breath and close your eyes. You keep sinking down the goo, and after some time
you lose consciousness.
When you come to, you notice that you are on solid ground... in a cave.
