ST0
This cave houses a flesh-eating plant. Its thick green stem runs up to a 
orrifying head, with gruesome teeth. It noticed you and it moves its wide-open
mouth in your direction. Before you've been able to make a move, you're
tangled up in the monster. The plant puts its teeth in your neck.
ST1
With its little scavy tongue, the plant licks your blood of its mouth. It
looks at you again with its geen eyes, and prepares to sink its teeth in your
neck again.
ST2
Once more, the plant's mouth encloses your neck. A warm stream of blood runs
down over your back, and now the pain is unbearable. After a while, the plant
lets go of you again.
ST3
The remains of what used to be a flesh-eating plant are now on the floor of
the cave. It's mouth is wide open, and its eyes almost roll out of their
sockets. The blood of its victims slowly drips out of its stem.
At the spot where his molded roots used to be, an opening has appeared.
ST4
The flesh-eating plant is little more than a mound of stinking garden waste.
