There's no use.__
You're still in one piece!_
You can't go there._
Are you sure you want to leave the earth to die? 
_Good!_
That doesn't yield anything useful._
You put %s down._
Your pockets are filled to the brim and you can't fit %s_in them._
You pick up %s and put it in one of your pockets._
It's way too dark to look at anything._
