ST0
You've disturbed the peace of the red troll. He looks deeply annoyed.
ST1
Now the troll is properly awake. He grabs his whip and appraches you
threateningly.
ST2
The troll hits you hard whit his whip. You feel the burning pain down to your
bones.
ST3
Foam runs from the troll's mouth. He rises his sword again.
ST4
Excitedly, the troll snatches the booklet. He flips through it and turns more
and more red. At some point a gurgling noise emerges from the creature, and he
blows up with a bang. The remains of the troll slowly drip down from the cave
walls.
Suddenly, you see something glimmer.
ST5
Pieces of the torn-up troll are spread throughout the cave. Slime pulls at
your shoes, and a filthy stench creeps up your nose.
