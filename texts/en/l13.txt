ST1
You throw the positron bomb into the lava with a lackluster curve. Sissing
loudly, the bomb slowly sinks down. At some point, the lava starts bubbling
weirdly and suddenly changes from red to green. Then you see a lightning flash
from the lava. After that, it calms down again.

It looks like you've saved the planet from total destruction by this positron
weapon, the origins of which are partly your making. Your mission is complete,
and tired and full of emotions you leave the cave system.
ST2
In front of you, there's a crater from which lava bubbles up. A thick vapor
emerges from the lava, and a red glow lights the surroundings. The heat is 
enormous, but the thermal suit protects you from burning.
ST3
In front of you, there's a crater from which lava bubbles up. The heat is so
intense that you suffer a number of burns and get blown backwards.
