ST0
There's a heavy, closed door in the north. Next to it is a dragon's head with
an open mouth. There's a heavy lock on the door.
ST1
You put the crystal in the mouth of the dragon's head, which subsequently
closes and reopens. The crystal has disappeared, and the eyes in the head
start to glow lightly.
ST2
The eyes of the dragon keep glowling lightly.
ST3
You put another crystal in the mouth. Again, it closes and opens, and again,
the crystal disappears. The shining from the eyes becomes stronger.
ST4
The eyes of the dragon keep glowing.
ST5
You put the last crystal in the mouth. The mouth closes once more, and now it
remains shut. The glow from the eyes keeps intensifying. At some point, the
glow converges into a very bright beam of light that shoots past you and gets
reflected by a mirror just behind you. With grisly precision, the mirror
reflects the light onto the heavy lock, which evaporates due to the enormous
heat.
Then, the door slowly opens while squeaking loudly.
ST6
The heavy door is now open and provides access to a room.
