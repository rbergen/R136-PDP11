ST0
A large dragon resides in this cave. It has multiple heads, each of which
watch you with yellow eyes. It's entire skin is covered in mold, and from its
mouths hang long, brown tongues, from which a biting acid drips. Suddenly, a
rumbling noise comes from one of the mouths. With difficulty you make out 
"Are you a cookie?"
ST1
The heads of the dragon are now moving more agressively and start to puff
heavily.
The air from the dragon heads smells awful, and you bounce back of disgust.
One of the mouths open wide, and louder than before it sounds "ARE YOU A
COOKIE?!?"
ST2
The dragon slowly lifts one of its filthy legs, and suddenly strikes hard.
Something in your head crunches, and dizziness takes you. The dragon gets
ready to hit you again.
ST3
The dragon grabs the cookie, and instantly sticks it in of its large mouths.
Slowly it starts to wobble, and with a muted thump it slams to the ground.
A little drool runs from the mouth in which the cooky just disappeared. The
dragon sleeps.
ST4
The dragon sleeps restlessly. Sometimes, one of its heads moves slightly, and
a deep growl emerges from its body.
ST5
Carefully, you put the nightcap on the dragon. The happy colours of the cap
stand out against the molded skin, and the cap slides to the side a litte.
Suddenly something falls, and it clatters on the hard rock floor.
ST6
The dragon sleeps peacefully.
