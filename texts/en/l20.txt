When you walk into this cave, you see a number of pulsating lights on the
ceiling. Against one of the walls, there's an enormous machine with a number
of control panels and displays.
As you walk over there to take a better look, you trip over a pedal in the
floor, after which a siren stars wailing. Overcome by fear you stay down, and
you see that the lights on the ceiling start burning brighter and large
amounts of data flash across the computer screens. Then you see a blinding
flash and you feel weightless for a moment.
When you can see again, you notice that the lights and the machine have
disappeared.
More so, you're outside...
