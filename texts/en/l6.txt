ST0
A large door that is rusted shut is at the northern side. It can no longer be
opened with bare hands.
ST1
You put one end of the bone under the door, and you start pushing down on the
other.
After extensive wiggling, the door starts to creak and squeak, and a crack
appears. You push down once more, and slowly the door swings open.
ST2
The door is now open and provides access to a cave.
