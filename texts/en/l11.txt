ST0
There's a Beull-branded computer that consists of a cabinet with a 3.5" drive
and a monitor. The monitor displays: "Please enter data disk"
ST1
The computer's still waiting.
ST2
The drive starts to read and after a short time information appears on the
screen. It reads: "In the lowest cave system, one must follow a letter route
that results in the name of the object that is to be found."
After a little while, the screen goes black.
ST3
There's nothing to see on the monitor and the computer is silent.
