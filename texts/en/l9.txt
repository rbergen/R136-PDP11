ST0
In a small, open area there is a large, bone-dry, dead tree. There's a sign on
the stem that reads "Smoking and naked flames prohibited".
ST1
An enormous flame erupts from the flamethrower. Slowly, the tree starts to
burn, and soon it's ablaze. The flames spread around, and the entire forest
starts to burn. You're surrounded by an ocean of fire, and the heat is
enormous.

Some roots still stick from the ground. Next to them lies a charred part of a
sign that reads "Sm   ng a   na  d fl     pro    t d".
